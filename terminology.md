or groups of letters that represent the individual speech sounds are called graphemes.

- Phonemes represent sounds, and graphemes include alphabetical letters, characters, numerical digits, etc.

- A lexicon in linguistics is the entire inventory or set of a language's lexemes. A lexeme is the smallest unit of a language that bears some meaning
